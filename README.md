Hi Im Ran Shafir,
I've finished medical school and I'm interested in Radiology.
I've been experimenting with web devolpement for over 5 years now(some during medical school),
currently Im working on enhancing a project by OHIF, a Radiology workstation written in ReactJS.
I have started an educational application for learning medical radiology in a modern "computer science" approach,
meaning using terms and ideas from computer science in order to better understand medical terms, and even more 
medical context, which in my opinion is hard to integrate in the general medicine degree in a non frontal way, at least nowadays.
you can find it at 
http://www.radioresearch.app

Open for work in projects involving radiology interfaces and am ready to learn machine learning if needed.
My current skills include, but are not limited to: 

General physician, with all that applies.

programming skills:

  Web and others: Javascript and Typescript
  
  Web: HTML,CSS and ReactJS
  
  Always passionate to learn something new!
